    /*
     * My obfuscation algorithm is similar in concept to the OAEP
     * encoding used in some forms of RSA. Here's a specification
     * of it:
     * 
     * 	+ We have a `masking function' which constructs a stream of
     * 	  pseudorandom bytes from a seed of some number of input
     * 	  bytes.
     * 
     * 	+ We pad out our input bit stream to a whole number of
     * 	  bytes by adding up to 7 zero bits on the end. (In fact
     * 	  the bitmap passed as input to this function will already
     * 	  have had this done in practice.)
     * 
     * 	+ We divide the _byte_ stream exactly in half, rounding the
     * 	  half-way position _down_. So an 81-bit input string, for
     * 	  example, rounds up to 88 bits or 11 bytes, and then
     * 	  dividing by two gives 5 bytes in the first half and 6 in
     * 	  the second half.
     * 
     * 	+ We generate a mask from the second half of the bytes, and
     * 	  XOR it over the first half.
     * 
     * 	+ We generate a mask from the (encoded) first half of the
     * 	  bytes, and XOR it over the second half. Any null bits at
     * 	  the end which were added as padding are cleared back to
     * 	  zero even if this operation would have made them nonzero.
     * 
     * To de-obfuscate, the steps are precisely the same except
     * that the final two are reversed.
     * 
     * Finally, our masking function. Given an input seed string of
     * bytes, the output mask consists of concatenating the SHA-1
     * hashes of the seed string and successive decimal integers,
     * starting from 0.
